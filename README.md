![cherry MX eagle library](library.png?raw=true)

This fork includes
1. *symmetric* footprints for switches which allows use on both sides of a PCB. This is especially useful in cases of a split design that uses symmetric PCBs.
2. versions of all layouts without the square silk screen.

Follow [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle/using-the-sparkfun-libraries) for instructions on how to add the library to Eagle.
