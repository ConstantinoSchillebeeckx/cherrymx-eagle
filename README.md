==============

This fork includes "symmetric" footprints for switches which allows use on both sides of a PCB. This is especially useful in cases of a split design that uses symmetric PCBs. Note that in the symmetric version, the diameter for the mirrored pins are reduced from 0.1 to 0.076 in order to make DIY routing (e.g. with Othermill) possible using a 1/64th end mill bit.

#### a basic eagle library for cherry mx keyswitches

I created this repository for this eagle library after recieving a number of messages from people who found mention of it in google results and inquired to me for a copy. I'm happy (even eager) to share my work with others who can make use of it.

*Update*: As of January 2014 the library has been verified to work on an actual PCB.  Specifically, it has been tested with MX1A-11NW switches.  You will definitely want a part ending in "W" ("With pins") if the switches will be PCB mounted. (Thanks [daveho](https://github.com/daveho)!)
