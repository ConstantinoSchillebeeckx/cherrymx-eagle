![cherry MX eagle library](http://i.imgur.com/jVGWHdO.png)

a very basic barebones eagle library for cherry mx keyswitches

I created this repository for this eagle library after recieving a number of messages from people who found mention of it in google results and inquired to me for a copy. I'm happy (even eager) to share my work with others who can make use of it.

However, despite creating this library, I as of yet haven't tested it on a real PCB. I have done my best to verify it by printing it out and even laser cutting it into plastic to check alignment, but have not had the chance to test with a PCB. For that reason, if you do use it on a PCB, PLEASE contact me to let me know everything came OK. Also, if you modify or expand the library, please contribute your work back to this repository so that others can benefit.
