This fork includes "symmetric" footprints for switches which allows use on both sides of a PCB. This is especially useful in cases of a split design that uses symmetric PCBs.

#### a basic eagle library for cherry mx keyswitches

I created this repository for this eagle library after recieving a number of messages from people who found mention of it in google results and inquired to me for a copy. I'm happy (even eager) to share my work with others who can make use of it.

*Update*: As of January 2014 the library has been verified to work on an actual PCB.  Specifically, it has been tested with MX1A-11NW switches.  You will definitely want a part ending in "W" ("With pins") if the switches will be PCB mounted. (Thanks [daveho](https://github.com/daveho)!)
